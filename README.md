apachestuff
===========
These are a set of Apache scripts and tools that I have used for years to do
things like:

# Validate apache releases (their GPG ASC files and MD5 checksums)
# Download and stage an apache release (e.g., in the Incubator)
# Measure the health of the Incubator by assessing its mentors

And other stuff. Enjoy!
