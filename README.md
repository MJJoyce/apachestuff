apachestuff
===========
These are a set of Apache scripts and tools that I have used for years to do things like:

1. Validate apache releases (their GPG ASC files and MD5 checksums)
2. Download and stage an apache release (e.g., in the Incubator)
3. Measure the health of the Incubator by assessing its mentors

And other stuff. Enjoy!
